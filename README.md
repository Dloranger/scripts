OpenRepeater Build Scripts
=======

Misc scripts live here like system build scripts. This is a Work-In-Progress...

The idea behind the repeater_build.sh file is that it can be used by developers to build fresh systems on new installs of Raspbian (Raspberry Pi) and Debian on the Beaglebone Black. These are the two SBCs I've been playing with, but it could be used or tweaked to run on other Debian based SBCs. These could then be used to create system images for others to download and get up and running more quickly by just flashing their device with the appropriate image. 

This script is not finished and some things still need to be done by hand...so it still needs work. Hopefully others with more Shell experience can make it better.

To use it, simply WGET it to your home directory and run it as root.
