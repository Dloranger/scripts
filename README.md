Install scripts live here.

There is 1 scripts per board. in the main dir's

Script installs via debian pkgs for debian jessie os .

This is a Work-In-Progress... 
If a script is broken . 
Please report it but be polite about it.
Do not just send a msg saying its broken and comment on how can this happen . 
This is a opensource project and the developers are not getting paid for the
time they put in on this project.

Currently we have 3 boards supported the BeagleBone Black, The Raspi B+/Pi-2,
and the Odroid C1/C1+. 

These scripts will most Likly work on other system but will need modifications.

To use it, simply WGET it to your home directory and run it as root.
