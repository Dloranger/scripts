OpenRepeater Build Scripts
=======

Misc scripts live here like system build scripts and pkg based install scripts.

There are 2 scripts per board. in the main dir's

In the Dev Scripts dir 1 script per board.

Script 1 is a install source. and it builds and installs svxlink/openrepeater. 

Script 2 installs via debian pkgs for debian jessie os imgs .Support 

This is a Work-In-Progress... If a script is broken . Please report it but be polite about it.
Do not just send a msg saying its broken and comment on how can this happen . This is a opensource 
project and the developers are not getting paid for the time they put in on this project.

Currently we have 3 boards supported the BeagleBone Black, The Raspi B+/Pi-2, and the Odroid C1/C1+. 

Intel-AMD64 now supported.  Geared for Minn0w V2 boards (Will work normal intel/amd boards.)

These scripts will most Likly work on other system but will need modifications.

To use it, simply WGET it to your home directory and run it as root.
